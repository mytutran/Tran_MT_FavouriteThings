### Introduction
Pick 3 things you love and create an app that showcases those things. Design a database
that contains at least 4 columns and include an image of some kind and descriptive
data about each of those things.

Check out the :arrow_right:[Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VTm51_YJNhscjOZAZnEffVy67XGTmrKlOZZehDjwN9A/edit?usp=sharing) for this project!

## Getting Started
:heavy_exclamation_mark:IMPORTANT:heavy_exclamation_mark:: Import `evans_favourites.sql` inside `includes` folder before opening `index.html` to check stuff out. For things to work, database's name has to be `evans_favourites` and table's name has to be `favourites`!
- Clone this project into your `localhost` root folder.
- Before opening `index.html`, make sure to import the database inside `includes` folder. (:heavy_exclamation_mark:Check out IMPORTANT message before installing!)
- You're ready! Check the website out by opening `index.html` with a browser that works well with interactive and responsive designs. Check out [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)).
- Check out the codes by using a Code Editor: [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/), or [Atom](https://atom.io/).
